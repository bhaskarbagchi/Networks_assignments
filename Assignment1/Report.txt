Introduction
------------

* Nyquist criterion:
For a a frequency (fmax) limited waveform, quantized with L levels, will require at least 2fmax * log(L) bits to be
transmitted per second where L is no. of quantization levels.

* Shannon's result:
Bits transmitted per second should not exceed Blog(1+SNR) B being the bandwidth of the channel. 

Thus,
	2fmax * log(L) ≤ B * log(1+SNR).

If these L levels are not sufficient to quantize the signal satisfactorily, either L can be increased as far as possible
or fmax has to be decreased.

Experiment design
-----------------

* A source signal is created by superimposing 5 sinusoids that are randomly chosen, ensuring that the maximum frequency  
  of the signal is limited to fmax. 

* The composite signal is then sampled at the given frequency and  quantized with given no. of quantization levels. 

* Noise is randomly added to the quantized waveform within a given maximum noise both positive and negative. 

* At the receiver's end the noisy quantized waveform is then reconstructed using cubic spline interpolation. 

* Mean squared error is calculated and displayed for the given test case. 

* From the plot of mean squared error vs. sampling frequencies, fmax is predicted according to Nyquist criterion at
  L = sqrt(1 + SNR).
  At sampling frequency greater than 2*fmax the mean squared error is very low and rises fairly quickly below 2*fmax.
  Hence, the rate of change of slope of the plot should be maximum around 2*fmax and hence fmax is predicted.

Key results
-----------

* At sampling frequency greater than 2*fmax the mean squared error is very low and rises fairly quickly below 2*fmax.

* B in our experiment is fmax since we superimpose waves with frequency in the range (0, fmax) chosen randomly.
  Hence,
  2fmax * log(L) ≤ fmax * log(1 + SNR)				... Shannon-Nyquist criterion.

  Effective number of distingushable levels L shoud be sqrt(1 + SNR) where SNR is signal to noise ratio.  

  This similarity in form between Shannon's capacity and Nyquist criterion should not be interpreted to mean that L 
  pulse levels can be literally sent without any confusion; more levels are needed, to allow for redundant coding and 
  error correction, but the net data rate that can be approached with coding is equivalent to using that L in Nyquist 
  criterion.
